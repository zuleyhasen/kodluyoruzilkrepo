                    <li><p class="p , movies-p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toy Story is a beloved animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 1995. Directed by John Lasseter, it was the first feature-length film entirely created using CGI (computer-generated imagery). The story revolves around a group of toys that come to life when humans aren't watching.
                        The main characters include Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure. The movie explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the challenges of change as Woody and Buzz embark on a journey to overcome their differences and work together.
                        Toy Story was groundbreaking in animation history and led to three successful sequels, forming a cherished franchise enjoyed by both children and adults worldwide.</p></li>

                    <li><p class="p , movies-p">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Out 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to the 2015 Pixar classic. The story picks up as Riley, now a 13-year-old, navigates the challenges of adolescence, including high school, friendships, and hockey camp. With the introduction of four new emotions—Anxiety, Embarrassment, Envy, and Ennui—the movie delves into the complexities of teenage emotions and personal growth.
                        The plot focuses on Riley adjusting to a significant transition: her best friends are going to a different school, and she faces intense pressure to redefine herself. Inside her mind, the new emotions clash with the original ones, creating turmoil and leading Riley to moments of self-doubt.
                        This sequel maintains Pixar's tradition of tackling universal themes with humor and heart, making it relatable to both younger audiences and adults.</p></li>
